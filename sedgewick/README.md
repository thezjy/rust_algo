# Sedgewick Rust

Some Data Structures and Algorithms from the book [Algorithms](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/) implemented in Rust.

To run the code you need to download the [test data files](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/algs4-data.zip) (which I don't include in this git repo cause it's too big) from the book site and unzip it in **this** directory as `algs4-data`.

The code here is either complete or optimal. It's soley for learning.
